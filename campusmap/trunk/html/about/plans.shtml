<h2>Plans</h2>

<p>Some parts of the application are not yet complete. This is a very brief
outline of what we still plan to do. (This will all probably get done between
the end of Summer Session I and the beginning of Fall 2005.) Crossed-off items
have been completed.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strike><b>Complete path data.</b> The current path data is for
	demonstration only and is in no way complete. Now that we have obtained
	a vector version of the base map we wish to use, we can create our base
	images and enter full path and location data.</strike> A detailed data
	set has been entered. What remains is to tweak the data, and connect a
	few remaining locations.</li>


	<li><strike><b>A better base map.</b> The current map is the visitor map
	PDF. (It even still has the key in the upper right-hand corner!) We
	would like to use the colored visitor map, such as the one that is used by <a
	href="http://maps.ucsd.edu/Viewer.htm?Zoom=2&Map=Visitor&O.x=88&O.y=73&Cmnd=Mgfy&View=Medium&P.x=206&P.y=154">maps.ucsd.edu</a>.</strike></li>

	<li><strike><b>Complete building codes.</b> The application supports
	associating a building code with each location (i.e., &quot;PCYNH&quot;
	with &quot;Pepper Canyon Hall&quot;), and many, but not all, have been
	entered.</strike></li>

	<li><strike><b>Google Maps-style scrolling.</b> Who can resist?</strike></li>

</ul>

<h2>Extensibility</h2>

<p>
	These features are not specifically planned, but they are listed to
	give an idea of how this project could expand:

</p>


<ul>
	<li><b>Building maps.</b> Click on an individual building name to open
	a sub-map (complete with all the features of the existing map --
	locations, path finding, etc) of the inside of that building.</li>

	<li><b>Maps of other locations.</b> For instance, an individual college
	could have more detailed path information covering just their area of
	campus. The map application is flexible, however, and the editor makes
	it easy to add path data to <i>any</i> map, not just one of UCSD.</li>

	<li><b>Integration with other applications.</b> Each location may have
	an associated building code, so it is easy for external applications
	that know building codes to build URLs for the map. As an example, to
	show the path between CENTR and PCYNH, you simply access
	<i>map.cgi?from=<b>CENTR</b>&amp;to=<b>PCYNH</b></i>.</li>

</ul>
