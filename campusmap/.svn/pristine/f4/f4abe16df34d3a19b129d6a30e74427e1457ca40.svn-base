<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
	CampusMap is an application that provides students and visitors with
	visual directions around campus. Pathfinding data is created with a
	visual editor, and displayed to users via a web interface.
</p>

<p>
	The editor, a desktop application, is used to overlay an existing map
	image with data about the locations that appear on the map and the
	paths between those locations. From inside the editor, the path data
	can be converted to a graph and exported to a file format readable by
	the online interface.
</p>

<p>
	Through the online interface, users may search for up to two locations at a
	time and view the shortest path between them, as well as the distance and
	approximate walking time (based on user-adjustable walking speed) of that path.
	Users may drag, scroll, and zoom the map in real-time, in the style of Google
	Maps. This allows for the quick and easy viewing of the whole campus. Based on
	optional keywords attached to each location in the editor, users may also
	search for the closest location of a certain kind. (For example, to find the
	closest parking lot to a given building.)

<h2>Thanks</h2>
