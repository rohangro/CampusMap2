  <h1>Oh no! CampusMap is over quota! :(</h1>
  <p>We're terribly sorry, we've exceeded our App Engine quota. Most likely we
  either became more popular, got stingier, or wrote some terrible code. Maybe
  someone linked to us. (If that was you, thanks!)</p>
  <p>Email <a href="mailto:m@michaelkelly.org">Michael</a> you want to tell us
  our good fortune, or yell at us.</p>
