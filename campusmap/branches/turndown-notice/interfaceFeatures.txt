UCSDMap (implemented) Interface Features:

Location name labels:
	- Colored based on whether the location was entered in the start or
	  end box
		- label is colored green if entered in the start box, red if
		  entered in the end box.
	- If there's no room to display the location label to the right of
	  the location then it will be displayed on the left.
		- Exception: when the label cannot be displayed either on the
		  left or the right. (If this happens, both location names
		  still appear to the left of the map.)
	- These rules for displaying of the location labels hold while moving
	  on the map. 	

Moving and zooming with the map:
	- Navigation bar operations:
		- Navigation arrows: pan to the North, South, East, or West.
		- Circle (in the center of the navigation arrows): returns the
		  map to the default zoom and center of the currently
		  displayed path or location (the same as clicking the
		  "submit" button again).
		- Zoom bar:
			- Plus and Minus arrows: Moves to the next lower or
			  higher zoom level.
			- Ovals: Go directly to zoom level. (Red oval
			  represents current zoom level)
	- Clicking on the map centers the map on the point clicked
	- Clicking on the thumbnail (upper right) centers the map on
	  the point clicked

Thumbnail:
	- Show the overall view of the map
	- Blue rectangle shows the current map display
	- If applicable, green and red boxes indicate the start and end
	  locations
	- Thumbnail is synchronized with map operations and vice versa

Searching for a location:
	- A location can be typed into either the start or end box near the
	  top of the page or selected in the drop down menu
	- Fuzzy matching for typed location names
		- When there is only one close match: Auto-corrects and
		  displays the location
		- Displays a list of hyperlinks when there are multiple close
		  matches (sorted by closeness)
			- If the other entry field has a valid (or
			  auto-corrected) location entered, the list of
			  hyperlinks contains the distance of each suggested
			  location to the valid location (or infinity if it
			  cannot be reached).
		- The desired location can be displayed by clicking on the
		  corresponding hyperlink

Displaying of shortest known path between locations:
	- When two locations are entered, the shortest known path is found
	  between the two points
		- Computation of the shortest path is accomplished using
		  Dijkstra's Algorithm on provided datafiles
		- Datafile properties can be set to stop the shortest path
		  from going through certain locations (so people aren't
		  directed to walk through buildings)
		- Datafile properties can be set to allow for bridges and
		  tunnel
	- Information of the path is displayed to the left of the navigation
	  bar:
		- The from (start) location is underlined and labeled in green
		- The to (end) location is underlined and labeled in red
		- The distance between the two location is displayed in miles.
		- The time it takes to walk between the two locations is
		  displayed based on entry of walking speed (15min/mile
		  default)
	- The path is displayed on the map:
		- The path is drawn in blue on the map between the two labeled
		  locations
		- The drawn path will maintain itself through different zoom
		  levels and recentering
	- Default display:
		- The highest zoom level is used such that all of the path can
		  still be displayed on the map.
			- Thus, by default, all elements of the path will be
			  viewable (Exception: when the path is too big for
			  the lowest zoom level)
				- In this case, the display centers on the end
				  location

Data caching:
	- All displayed paths are cached and will be retrieved if they are
	  requested again
		- Caching prevents the need to load two of the main datafiles
		  and run Dijkstra's algorithm.
		- This allows for faster zooming and moving around the map
		- The length of time that the cache files are retained is
		  adjustable (currently 10 minutes)

Notes:
	- You can find the distance to the nearest food facility by entering a
	  start location and "food" for the end location
