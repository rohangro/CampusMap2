<h2>Why Not Google Maps?</h2>

<p>
	The <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a>,
	which allows developers to use Google Maps to power their own
	applications, may seem to eliminate the need for a specialized
	application like CampusMap. However, largely because it focuses on city
	roads and driving directions, and we do not believe it suits the needs
	of UCSD.

</p>

<h3>Advantages of CampusMap</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Access to detailed maps.</b> UCSD has detailed maps of campus
	and high-resolution satellite images, which CampusMap can readily use.
	Google Maps is limited to Google's map, which is much less detailed,
	and satellite images, which are lower-resolution.</li>

	<li><b>Flexibility.</b> The editor we created to enter path data can be used to
	enter path data for <i>any</i> base map, not just the UCSD campus. If
	UCSD ever needs internal building maps, or other maps that Google would
	not have, they can readily be created and used.</li>

	<li><b>Visual consistency.</b> CampusMap can (and in fact plans to) use
	the maps that UCSD already has displayed on kiosks around campus.
	Google Maps uses only the maps Google has created.</li>

	<li><b>Future reliability.</b> CampusMap does not rely on the goodwill of an external
	company -- in the <a
	href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html">Google Maps API Terms
	of Use</a> (section 1.5), Google explicitly reserves the right to include
	advertisements.</li>

	<li><b>General extensibility.</b> Should some unforeseen circumstance
	require the map to possess a new feature, UCSD will have access to the
	full code base of CampusMap, so any necessary changes can be made. See
	the Extensibility section of the <a href="plans.shtml#extend">plans</a>
	page.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Advantages of Google Maps</h3>

<p>...and how we can match (or beat) them.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Hybrid view.</b> This is the satellite image overlaid with road maps.
		<ul>
			<li>Because UCSD has both satellite images and detailed
			maps of campus, it would not be difficult to create a
			&quot;hybrid&quot; map like Google's by overlaying the
			road layer of one of the visitor maps on the satellite
			image. This would have the advantage of optionally
			including foot paths, and anything else that appears on
			UCSD's existing maps, instead of just public
			roads.</li>

			<li>In a nutshell, it is possible to create a hybrid
			map that is more flexible than Google's.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strike><b>Live scrolling/dragging/zooming.</b></strike>
		<ul>
			<li><strike>This is a planned feature of CampusMap. We plan on
			implementing it, <i>at the latest</i>, before the
			beginning of Fall quarter 2005.</strike> This has been implemented.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
